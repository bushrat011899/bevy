/// A spline composed of a single cubic Bezier curve.
///
/// Useful for user-drawn curves with local control, or animation easing. See
/// [`CubicSegment::new_bezier_easing`] for use in easing.
///
/// ### Interpolation
///
/// The curve only passes through the first and last control point in each set of four points. The curve
/// is divided into "segments" by every fourth control point.
///
/// ### Tangency
///
/// Tangents are manually defined by the two intermediate control points within each set of four points.
/// You can think of the control points the curve passes through as "anchors", and as the intermediate
/// control points as the anchors displaced along their tangent vectors
///
/// ### Continuity
///
/// A Bezier curve is at minimum C0 continuous, meaning it has no holes or jumps. Each curve segment is
/// C2, meaning the tangent vector changes smoothly between each set of four control points, but this
/// doesn't hold at the control points between segments. Making the whole curve C1 or C2 requires moving
/// the intermediate control points to align the tangent vectors between segments, and can result in a
/// loss of local control.
///
/// ### Usage
///
/// ```
/// # use bevy_math::{*, prelude::*};
/// let points = [[
///     vec2(-1.0, -20.0),
///     vec2(3.0, 2.0),

///
/// The 'NU' part of NURBS stands for "Non-Uniform". This has to do with a parameter called 'knots'.
/// The knots are a non-decreasing sequence of floating point numbers. The first and last three pairs of
/// knots control the behavior of the curve as it approaches its endpoints. The intermediate pairs
/// each control the length of one segment of the curve. Multiple repeated knot values are called
/// "knot multiplicity". Knot multiplicity in the intermediate knots causes a "zero-length" segment,
/// and can create sharp corners.
///
/// ### Rationality
///
/// The 'R' part of NURBS stands for "Rational". This has to do with NURBS allowing each control point to
/// be assigned a weighting, which controls how much it affects the curve compared to the other points.
///
/// ### Interpolation
///
/// The curve will not pass through the control points except where a knot has multiplicity four.
///
/// ### Tangency
///
/// Tangents are automatically computed based on the position of control points.
///
/// ### Continuity
///
/// When there is no knot multiplicity, the curve is C2 continuous, meaning it has no holes or jumps and the
/// tangent vector changes smoothly along the entire curve length. Like the [`CubicBSpline`], the acceleration
/// continuity makes it useful for camera paths. Knot multiplicity of 2 in intermediate knots reduces the
/// continuity to C1, and knot multiplicity of 3 reduces the continuity to C0. The curve is always at least
/// C0, meaning it has no jumps or holes.
